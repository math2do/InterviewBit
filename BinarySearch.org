Use ~lower_bound~ to find the first occurence and ~upper_bound~ to find the end occurence of element B. The difference between these iterators returned by these two functions is the answer. If the element B doesn't exist, then same iterator will be returned by both ~upper_bound~ and ~lower_bound~. 

#+begin_src cpp
  int Solution::findCount(const vector<int> &A, int B) {
    auto upper = upper_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), B);
    auto lower = lower_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), B);

    return (int) (upper - lower);
  }

Find the peak point, =pivot=, from the *bitonic* array using binary search. While doing binary search, compare the element in the middle index ~m~ with element in index ~m-1~. This comparision will tell us how to narrow the search space.

Once =pivot= point is found, then look for the element in left and right of =pivot= using binary search functions like ~upper_bound~ or ~lower_bound~
